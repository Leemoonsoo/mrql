<H2>MRQL Releases</H2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.8.4.tgz">0.8.4</a> (09/27/2012):
Fixed the k-means clustering example.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.8.2.tgz">0.8.2</a> (08/26/2012):
Fixed a bug in testing the stopping condition of the repeat/closure expression in BSP mode.
Added support for LIMIT in repeat/closure expression in BSP mode.
Restriction: BSP local mode now works with one BSP task only.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.8.0.tgz">0.8.0</a> (08/23/2012):
Fixed compilation mode. Fixed bag materialization to
lazily cache stream-based bags into vectors. Fixed bag spill to local files when a bag becomes too large.
Added support for BSP evaluation using Hama.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.7.2.tgz">0.7.2</a> (05/01/2012):
Added the include statement. Used the JLine readline library. Fixed subtyping in typechecking.
Introduced persistent types !t and changed the type-inference to deduce which computations
can be run in memory and which in Hadoop.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.7.0.tgz">0.7.0</a> (03/01/2012):
Converted .gen files to use the new pattern matching syntax in GEN.
Allowed pattern variables to occur multiple times in MRQL patterns.
Added support for user-defined aggregations.
Added support for compilation of MR functional arguments
(good for computationally intensive jobs, such as the RMAT.mrql example).
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.6.2.tgz">0.6.2</a> (10/27/2011):
Introduced new map-reduce operators with total aggregation. Fixed bugs in string and bag raw-comparissons.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.6.0.tgz">0.6.0</a> (10/19/2011):
Stable release. Changed the Copyright to Apache 2.0. Ported to Hadoop 0.20.205.0. Improved serialization. Fixed some bugs.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.5.4.tgz">0.5.4</a> (10/12/2011):
Improved serialization. Fixed a bug with UDFs.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.5.2.tgz">0.5.2</a> (10/1/2011):
Added ranges n..m for data generation. Improved type checking and type errors.
Fixed the problem of calling UDFs by a task tracker (UDF definitions are now stored in Configuration).
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.5.tgz">0.5</a> (08/24/2011): MapCombineReduce is
now using in-mapper combining instead of a combiner class.  Added
support for JSON. Added support for user-defined parsers. Added
templates.  Added repetition.  Added optimization that fuses a join
with a group-by over the same attribute to optimize pagerank.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.4.tgz">0.4</a> (07/26/2011):
Fixed fragment-replicate join for the compile-mode. Derived the map-reduce combine function from the reduce function.
Implemented cross products and theta joins. Spilled large bags to files. Fixed MRQL to work on Amazon Elastic MapReduce.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.3.tgz">0.3</a> (06/20/2011):
Ported to cloudera installation (CDH3: hadoop 0.20.2).
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.2.tgz">0.2</a> (05/31/2011):
Removed the libreadline-java dependency. Added cleanup of temporary files.
Implemented the fragment-replicate join
using the Hadoop distributed cache. If at least one of the MapReduce2 join 
is small (less than 100MBs by default), MRQL uses fragment-replicate join.
It does not work in compiled mode yet.
<li> <a href="/mrql-0.1.tgz">0.1</a> (05/05/2011): First beta release. Still missing: a cost model for query optimization, adaptive query optimization, implementation of fragment-replicate join,
automatic adjustment of Hadoop configuration parameters, such as, number of reducers, spilling large bags to disk, MRQL syntax to import Java methods
(currently, method importing is hardwired).
