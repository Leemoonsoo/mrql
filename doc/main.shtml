<H2>MRQL: an Optimization Framework for Map-Reduce Queries</H2>
</center>
<p>

MRQL (the Map-Reduce Query Language) is an SQL-like query language for
large-scale, distributed data analysis.
MRQL is powerful enough to express most common data analysis tasks
over many different kinds of raw data, including hierarchical data and
nested collections, such as XML data. It is more powerful than other
current languages, such as Hive and Pig Latin, since it can operate on
more complex data and supports more powerful query constructs, thus
eliminating the need for using explicit map-reduce code.
<p>
MRQL can run in two modes: in MR (Map-Reduce) mode using
<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a> and in BSP (Bulk
Synchronous Parallel) mode
using <a href="http://hama.apache.org/">Apache Hama</a>.  Both modes
use Apache's HDFS (the Hadoop Distributed File System) to read and
write their data.
<p>
In MR mode, an MRQL query is translated to a workflow of map-reduce
jobs, where each job reads its input and writes its output on HDFS.
This simplifies reliability and fault tolerance but it imposes a high
overhead to complex MR workflows and graph algorithms, such as
PageRank, which require repetitive MR jobs.  In addition, MR does not
preserve data in memory between the map and reduce tasks
or across consecutive MR jobs. This restriction requires to read data
at every step, even when the data is constant. BSP, on the other
hand, does not suffer from this restriction, and, under certain
circumstances, allows complex repetitive algorithms to run entirely in
the collective memory of a cluster.  BSP is a good choice when fault
tolerance is less important, data (both input and indermediate) can
fit in the cluster memory, and data processing requires
complex/repetitive steps.
