<H2>MRQL: Installation Instructions</H2>
</center>
<p>
MRQL is an open-source software developed at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA).
Please read the <a href="COPYRIGHT">copyright notice</a>.
<p>
MRQL can run in two modes: in Map-Reduce mode using
<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a>
and in BSP mode (Bulk Synchronous Parallel mode) using <a href="http://hama.apache.org/">Apache Hama</a>.
The BSP mode is currently experimental (not fine-tuned yet) and lacks any fault-tolerance
(if an error occurs, the entire job must be restarted).
<p>
The MRQL map-reduce mode has been tested on Linux on the following Hadoop distributions:
<ul>
<li> Hadoop MapReduce releases 0.20.205.0, 0.21.0, 0.22.0, 1.0.1, and 1.0.3.
You can download the latest <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/mapreduce/">hadoop-*.tar.gz<a/>
from Apache.
<li> Cloudera CDH3 Update 2 (cdh3u2),
which includes the Hadoop MapReduce release 0.20.2 and all the latest patches.
You can install the <a href="https://ccp.cloudera.com/display/SUPPORT/Downloads">CDH3 tarball</a>
distribution from Cloudera.
</ul>
The following instructions assume that you have already installed Hadoop MapReduce
and you have deployed it on your cluster successfully.
Otherwise, follow the directions in
<a href="http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-hadoop-on-ubuntu-linux-multi-node-cluster/">Running Hadoop On Ubuntu Linux</a>.
Most important change: change the JAVA_HOME in <tt>conf/hadoop-env.sh</tt>
to point to your Java installation directory.
<p>
<h3>How to install MRQL </h3>
Download the <a href="/mrql.tgz">latest release of MRQL</a> (currently, version 0.8.2) and extract the files.
The jar files <tt>mrql.jar</tt> and <tt>mrql-bsp.jar</tt> contain the code for MRQL map-reduce and BSP, respectively.
They can be run using the scripts <tt>bin/mrql</tt> and <tt>bin/mrql.bsp</tt>.
<p>
<h3>How to run MRQL on a Hadoop MapReduce cluster:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Change the first lines of <tt>Makefile</tt> and <tt>bin/mrql</tt> to point to your directories.
One of these directories must be your existing Hadoop configuration directory.
<li> Test MRQL using <tt>bin/mrql queries/q1.mrql</tt>, which runs a simple query in map-reduce mode in memory,
and using <tt>bin/mrql -local queries/q1.mrql</tt>, which runs this query in Hadoop's stand-alone mode.
<li> If the existing <tt>mrql.jar</tt> doesn't match your Hadoop distribution,
you can recompile MRQL using <tt>make</tt>.
</ul>
For a real test, do the <a href="pagerank.html">PageRank example</a> on a small Hadoop MapReduce cluster.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Optional: How to run MRQL on a Hama cluster:</h3>
<ul>
<li> Download <a href="http://hama.apache.org/">Apache Hama</a>. The MRQL BSP mode has been tested on
Hama 0.5.0 on top of Hadoop 1.0.3 only.
<li> Follow the instructions in <a href="http://hama.apache.org/getting_started_with_hama.html">Getting Started with Hama</a> to set up and start Hama.
<li> Change the first lines of <tt>Makefile</tt> and <tt>bin/mrql.bsp</tt> to point to your directories.
One of these directories must be your existing Hama configuration directory.
<li> Test MRQL using <tt>bin/mrql.bsp queries/q1.mrql</tt>, which runs a simple query in BSP mode in memory,
and using <tt>bin/mrql.bsp -local queries/q1.mrql</tt>, which runs this query in Hama's stand-alone mode.
<li> If the existing <tt>mrql-bsp.jar</tt> doesn't match your Hadoop/Hama distributions,
you can recompile MRQL using <tt>make bsp</tt>.
</ul>
For a real test, do the <a href="pagerank.html">PageRank example</a> on a Hama cluster.
